The following is the incident report for the krystal infrastructure outage that occurred on March 23, 2023. We understand this service issue has impacted our valued users, and we apologize to everyone who was affected.


Summary of the Incident:
Our software system experienced a major outage on March 23, 2023 from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM WAT The outage lasted for approximately [2hours] and resulted in a complete disruption of service to our users/customers. The impact was severe, affecting a large number of users and leading to financial losses due to missed transactions.

Timeline of Events:
- 6:20PM : A sudden surge in user traffic was detected as a marketing campaign was launched.
- 6:30PM : The system started experiencing performance degradation, causing delays in response times.
- 6:40PM : The first reports of intermittent errors and failed transactions were received from users.
- 6:42PM : The operations team initiated an investigation, monitoring system logs and infrastructure health.
- 6:45PM : The system's performance deteriorated further, leading to a complete outage and unresponsive services.
- 6:46PM : The incident response team was mobilized, and communication was sent to notify users about the disruption.
- 7:20PM : The team began triaging the issue and conducted a thorough analysis of the system logs and error messages.
- 7:45PM : The root cause was identified as a database overload, causing the system to become unresponsive.
- 7:47PM : Emergency measures were implemented to restore the system, including scaling up the database infrastructure and deploying performance optimizations.
- 8:30PM : After several hours of intense effort, the system was brought back online, and services resumed.

Root Cause Analysis:
During the investigation, several contributing factors were identified as the root causes of the outage:

1. Increased User Traffic: The surge in user traffic resulting from the marketing campaign exceeded the system's capacity to handle the load. The sudden influx of requests overwhelmed the resources and led to performance degradation.

2. Inadequate Scalability: The system lacked sufficient scalability to handle sudden spikes in user traffic. The existing infrastructure was not designed to scale dynamically, causing bottlenecks and subsequent failure during peak loads.

3. Insufficient Database Capacity: The database infrastructure was not adequately provisioned to handle the increased load. The heavy transactional workload exceeded the database's capacity, resulting in a complete overload and subsequent unresponsiveness.

4. Monitoring and Alerting Gap: The monitoring system failed to provide timely alerts regarding the increasing resource utilization and performance degradation. This gap in monitoring delayed the response time and prevented early detection of the issue.

Lessons Learned:
Based on the simulated outage, the following actionable steps can be taken to prevent similar incidents:

1. Scalability and Capacity Planning: Enhance the system's capacity planning to account for sudden spikes in user traffic. Implement auto-scaling mechanisms and load testing to ensure the infrastructure can handle increased loads without degradation.

2. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting: Strengthen the monitoring infrastructure to provide real-time insights into system health and performance. Configure proactive alerts to notify the operations team of critical thresholds and potential bottlenecks.

3. Database Optimization: Optimize the database infrastructure to improve its capacity and performance. Conduct regular reviews of database utilization and implement scaling measures to ensure it can handle the workload efficiently.

4. Incident Response Readiness: Develop a well-defined incident response plan to ensure a prompt and effective response during outages. Assign clear roles and responsibilities, establish communication channels, and conduct regular drills to test the plan's effectiveness.

5. Load Testing and Performance Optimization: Implement
